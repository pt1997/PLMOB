# Pt1997's Linux Mobile Bootstrapping Script (PLMOB)

- PLMOB is inspired by SXMO but aims to be more touchscreen friendly. I also don't feel to comply to the suckless philosophy. It will use whatever I think is good.

- The main target hardware is the PinePhone Pro.

- This is a hobby project, I'll work on it when I work on it.

- The difference to something like Phosh is that it doesn't try to make an existing desktop environment work on Mobile hardware, but instead I just take what ever works reliable and put it together.

- Usability and stability are important for me. I'm fine with configuring things that don't need to be changed on a daily basis via CLI/TUI tools, they don't need a menu entry or button.

- Currently I'm trying to use PostmarketOS as base
